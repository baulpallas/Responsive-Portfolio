            Welcome to Paul Ballas' Bio webpage! Thanks for stopping by. If at
            any point you'd like to reach me directly, please select the
            'Contact' button above (estimated wait-time is 10 minutes). <br />
            <br />
            By way of background, I am an Investment Banker who helps healthcare
            institutins raise money by day and codes by night. Please see the
            'Portfolio' button above for examples of the projects that I have
            been working on recently. <br />
            <br />
            However, I'm interested in many more interesting things than just
            finance and programming. For example, I'm a drummer for two musical
            projects, snowboarder, have experience recording and mixing music
            and I love fitness. If you'd like to discuss any of these topics or
            anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out!
